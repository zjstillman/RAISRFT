Changing rcond in train can effect if simple or filtered is better.
Full 2 trained and tested on self:
Total simple upscale error: 7900.90
Total Filter Error: 8113.13
Why is filtering making things worse?
Fixed by not counting margn edge

Full 2 train Second run:
	Training data: 
	Total original to simple error = 7619.56
	Total original to filter error = 7492.47
	Testing Data Matches

Full 16 train, tested on full 2, ABS:
	Total original to simple error = 4383.90
	Total original to filter error = 4248.00

Real Images, testing:
Simple downsclaing 200 train and test on self:
	Total original to simple error = 94989.79
	Total original to filter error = 65450.74
Zero Padding 200 train and test on self:
	Total original to simple error = 52438.57
	Total original to filter error = 51341.36

FFT crop, bilinear upscale 100 images train/test(Likely error in calculating simple error):
	Total original to simple error = 3269603.47
	Total original to filter error = 28478.25
	This is a bit ridiculous, if it is actually this good like serious !wow!

FFT crop bilinear after scaling fix 100 images train/test:
	Total original to simple error = 53732.73
	Total original to filter error = 28371.43
	Bicubic:
	Total original to simple error = 51872.19
	Total original to filter error = 29053.14

Bilinear seems better

Extra vs no Extra in Bilinear version (100 test):
No Extra:
	Total original to simple error = 53732.73
	Total original to filter error = 27963.02
Extra:
	Total original to simple error = 53732.73
	Total original to filter error = 46814.68

No Extra is better it seems


Which parameter to increase:
	Total original to simple error: 53732.73
	Control:
		Total original to filter error: 27963.02

	Angle:
		Total original to filter error: 27712.12

	Coherence:
		Total original to filter error: 27697.30

	Strength:
		Total original to filter error: 27496.35

	All:
		Total original to filter error: 26068.63
